## <center> Ensuring Authenticity Problem
- We want to be able to certify and verify on the spot that a consumer is buying genuine Fredericksburg peaches.
- If a farmer falsely states that their peaches are grown in Fredericksburg, TX, then the Blockchain will provide a permanent record of the peaches place of origin.

## <center> Market Analysis
Here are some case examples of how Blockchain based tracking software has previously affected the agriculture industry. The same benefits to utilizing Blockchain technologies for the shipping and receiving of goods, will remain the same across all shipping based industries.
