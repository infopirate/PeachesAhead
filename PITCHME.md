#### A Factom Hackathon Presentation 

---

#### Milestones

- [X] Factom Chain Created (PeachChain)
- [X] MultiChain Blockchain Created (FarmChain)
- [X] Front-End Boilerplated (React-Boilerplate)
- [X] Backend & Frontend Integrated 
- [X] Test, Demonstrate, & Update! 

---

#### Project 

How does Blockchain enable the world to bypass paper?

- [X] paper-less supply chain demonstration, running on a blockchain network or 2..
- [X] A visual way of tracking / monitoring peaches.
- [X] Stand selling peaches that can be verified authentic. 

---

#### Main Priorities

Major Considerations:
Time, Functionality, Security, Savings, Effort

---

#### More stuff

Participants will be asked to use the Factom blockchain to create solutions using data from the Factom Blockchain instead of what would be traditionally stored on paper.
How useful is the solution?
How original is the solution?
Does the solution make good use of the Factom protocol?
Was your presentation clear and informative?

#### Even More stuff

Verification of "REAL" fredericksburg peaches from an Orchard in Fredericksburg, Texas

#### The Garbage In, Garbage Out Dillema

We may want to certify, for example, that a consumer is buying fredericksburg peaches. <br>
If the first step of the process involves a farmer stating that their peaches are grown in Fredericksburg, TX, but this is not true, then the blockchain is providing an indelible record that the peaches originate from a "false" location. 

Proposed Solution(s): Proof of Location

30 mins setting up factom api, auth issues, chain creation, creating an entry, the problems encountered, the olution involved.
so with api auth, pretty easy, obtain key, curl params;;
chain creation was a little trickier, took 2 modifications;;
adding entries,


  
{"errors":{"detail":"Bad request"}}

Master plan:

a label that has blockchain info on it that can verify information.. 
we accomplished this by using this as our project idea:
blockchain agri demo --

then we applied it to a business structure 

Demonstrate the web app scanning a qr code and receiving verifiable information..
