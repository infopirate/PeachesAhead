## Project Pitch
Question: How does Blockchain enable the world to bypass paper?

Answer:
- [ ] Paperless supply chain running on a Blockchain network.
- [ ] A visual way of tracking shipments from farm to market.
- [ ] Verify genuine stands selling peaches

## More stuff

Participants will be asked to use the Factom blockchain to create solutions using data from the Factom Blockchain instead of what would be traditionally stored on paper.

#### The Garbage In, Garbage Out Dilemma
**Problem:**
<br>
We want to be able to certify and verify on the spot that a consumer is buying genuine Fredericksburg peaches.
<br>
If a farmer stating that their peaches are grown in Fredericksburg, TX, but this is not true, then the blockchain is providing an indelible record that the peaches originate from a "false" location.

**Solution:**
Proof Of Location

Platin [https://platin.io/]

## Project Resources
<br>
Here are some case examples of how blockchain based tracking software has previously affected the agriculture industry. The same benefits to utilizing blockchain technologies for shipping and recieving of goods will remain the same across all shipping based industries.

## Thank You!
<br>
We would like to thank the Factom Hackathon event staff and organizers. Without this forum to showcase our skills then we would not have had the impetus to complete this daunting task.
